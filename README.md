# Cave-Escape
## Text-based RPG game 

The prototype being created is an adventure-style text-based console game, known as Cave Escape. The main goal of the game is for the player to escape the “cave” that they found themselves in, by collecting certain items needed to reach the goal. In the process of finding those items, the player will face multiple monsters in the cave, who will try to harm the player and stop them from escaping the cave. Nevertheless, the player can fight off these monsters whenever they encounter one. The entire game is built on different data structure methods that help to support the aim of the game.


## Main Storyline
The only way for the player to escape is to go through a portal, that can only be found at the starting point in the entire game’s map. However, this portal can only be activated when the player has successfully added the required “Portal Ring” and have guessed the portal’s password correctly. Therefore, the player needs to travel through the caves to find the “Portal Ring” and clues to the portal’s password. Along the way, they would have to survive any encounters with the monsters in the caves, as these monsters are hostile and would attack the player in sight. For every monster encounter, the player can choose to attack the player, but only if they have a weapon in hand and if that weapon in hand is not broken.
